Hi, my name ist Bert Radke and I 'do' software for over 20 years now.
In 2018 I moved with my family from Dresden to Munich.

My interest in all things computer started way back when I was still in high school. Back than, esp. in the former
east of germany, computers where not something easily available so I had to build my own from the scratch
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron_Z1013[Z1013]), or program on paper.

Times changed fast and by now I have programmed in languages ranging from C/C++ over PL/SQL (yuck!)
(and Oracle Forms, double yuck!), TypeScript and are currently Java for a wide variety of fields including
the semiconductor industry, energy trading, logistics and health care.

In the recent years I have give a few talks at local community events, mostly with my
friend https://twitter.com/magomi[Marco]. I'm by no means an experienced speaker, but, surprisingly, I enjoy presenting.

**This blog** is managed by https://hugo.io[Hugo], an static site generator, allowing me to write in
https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc]. Add https://github.com/taseroth[GitHub] and https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify]
to the mix and my inner nerd is happy and hopefully wont realize that blogging actually means writing.
The theme is based on https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/[Hyde-Hyde], with alterations to the layout and colouring.
Also, since Hugo now supports asset-pipelines, I make use of them to work with the scss directly.
